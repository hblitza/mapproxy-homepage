title: New MapProxy 1.11.0 release
---

We are pleased to announce the release of MapProxy 1.11.0. It
contains a lot of major and minor improvements.

The latest release is available at: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.11.0/>

### Improved support for ArcGIS compact caches

MapProxy now also supports version 2 of the ArcGIS compact cache format. The performance for version 1 was improved as well.

The new tool ``mapproxy-util defrag`` can be used to reduce the size of compact cache bundle safter tiles were removed/updated.

See: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.11.0/caches.html#compact> and <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.11.0/mapproxy_util.html#defrag-compact-cache>

### Improved reprojection

The accuracy for reprojections on low map scales improved while the performance improved for mid to high map scales.


### Improved HTTPS handling

MapProxy now uses CA certificates provided by your system if you use Python >=2.7.9 or >=3.4.
The ``ssl_no_cert_checks`` option was broken with these Python versions. This is now fixed. 
The ``ssl_ca_certs`` option is still available for older systems, or for custom CA certificates.

See: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.11.0/configuration.html#secure-http-connections-https>

### Other fixes and changes

There are a lot more changes and improvements. Please note that Python 2.6 is no longer supported.
