See [auth API](https://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/auth.html#limited-to).

### Demo service

The demo service now allows you to query WMS layers in all supported SRS.
It now also supports WMTS if you have enabled this service.


### Other improvements

- WMS 1.3.0 now supports extended layer capabilities for metadata etc.
- You can configure fallbacks for errors in tile sources. MapProxy can
 create an empty tile if the tile source returns a 404 not found for
 a tile, for example.

Note:
There was a bug in the configuration loader that permitted to have an
error in the layers configuration. Please make sure your configuration is
valid after upgrading.
