## New features

Some noteworthy improvements since 1.1.0 are:

#### Cache

You can use the MBTiles format for new caches and you can load existing
MBTiles cache files.

The directory layout for file based caches is now configurable and you
can choose a TMS compatible layout besides the default TileCache
compatible one.

See [cache configuration](https://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/configuration.html#cache).

#### `mapproxy-util scales` tool

The new `mapproxy-util scales` tool helps to convert between scales
and resolutions.

See [mapproxy-util documentation](https://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/mapproxy_util.html#scales).

#### Other features

- Mapnik source now supports the [selection of single layers](https://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/sources.html#mapnik).
