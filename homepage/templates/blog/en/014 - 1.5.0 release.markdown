title: New MapProxy 1.5.0 release
---


We are pleased to announce the release of MapProxy 1.5.0. It
contains a lot of major and minor improvements.

The latest release is available at: <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/>

## New features

Some noteworthy improvements since 1.4.0 are:


#### Clipping WMTS/TMS/KML requests to polygons

The security API now also supports limiting requests to polygon geometries
for all tile services.

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/auth.html#limited-to>


#### Mixed image mode

The mixed image mode automatically chooses between PNG and JPEG format
depending if the image has transparency or not. This is a great feature
for aerial images with transparency at the image boundaries. Thanks to
Thomas Bonfort for the idea.

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/configuration.html#format>

#### Caches as source for other caches

You can now use a cache as a source for another cache. You can use this
to directly reproject tiles or to make changes to your grid configuration
without losing your existing cache.

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/configuration_examples.html#using-existing-caches>
and <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/configuration_examples.html#reprojecting-tiles>

#### Changed default SRS in WMS

The WMS now supports EPSG:3857, the official EPSG code of the Webmercator projection (EPSG:900913).
UTM 32/33N and Gauß-Krüger zones 3-5 were removed from the default list, since they are only usable in parts of Europe.
Make sure you've [configured all SRS you are using](http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/services.html#srs) in the service configuration.

#### New tools

There are three new tools:

- `mapproxy-util grids`: debug and analyze grid configuration
- `mapproxy-util wms-capabilities`: get bbox and min/max_scales of existing WMS
- `mapproxy-util export`: export (parts) of your cache to MBTiles or a TMS directory

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.5.0/mapproxy_util.html>


#### Other features

- use_grid_names option to access Tiles/TMS/KML layers by grid
 name instead of EPSGXXXX
- origin option for TMS to change default origin of the /tiles service
- continue stopped/interrupted seed processes
- support min_res/max_res for tile sources

#### Improvements

- do not show layers with incompatible grids in WMTS/TMS demo
- make 0/0/0.kml optional for the initial KML file
- use BBOX of coverage for capabilities in seed_only layers
- ignore debug layer when loading tile layers
- simplified coverage configuration
- add reloader option to make_wsgi_app()
- add MetadataURL to WMS 1.1.1 capabilities
- improved WMTS services with custom grids (origin)
- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client
- larger map in demo client
- always request with transparent=true in WMS demo client
- use in_image exceptions in WMS demo client
