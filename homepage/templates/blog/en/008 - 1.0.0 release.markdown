title: New MapProxy 1.0.0 release
---

We are finally ready to announce the release of MapProxy 1.0.0. It
contains lots of major and minor improvements.


The latest release is available at: <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install -U --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.0.0/>


#### Upgrade notes

A bug, introduced in a previous release, prevented that the tile locks get
removed. This issue is solved since 1.0.0b2 and MapProxy will remove existing
lock files on the first access to the cache. This might take a while if the
directory already contains a lot of lock files (probably thousands and more).

We suggest that you remove the complete lock directories by hand before
upgrading:

    rm -r cache_dir/*/tile_locks


### New features

Some noteworthy improvements are:

#### mapproxy-seed


mapproxy-seed got a new, flexible configuration format (the old format is
still supported). You can now define multiple seed and cleanup tasks and call
each separately from the command line interface (``--seed`` and ``--cleanup``
options).

It is now possible to reseed specific areas without triggering any cleanup.

There are also two new ``--summary`` and ``--interactive`` options that help
to understand what the seed tool will do.

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.0.0/seed.html>

#### FeatureInfo XSL transformations

MapProxy now supports content aware merging of multiple HTML/XML
feature responses and it supports XSL transformations.
See:  <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.0.0/configuration_examples.html#featureinformation>

#### Image manipulation

You can now make non-transparent layers transparent.
Either with an opacity value, with blends the layer over the others,
or with a color value that should be converted to transparent.
See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.0.0/sources.html#image-transparent-color>

#### Authentication

There is a new powerful authentication interface.
See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.0.0/auth.html>
