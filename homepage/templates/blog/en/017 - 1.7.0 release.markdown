title: New MapProxy 1.7.0 release
---

We are pleased to announce the release of MapProxy 1.7.0. It
contains a lot of major and minor improvements.

The latest release is available at: <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.7.0/>

### New features

Some noteworthy improvements since 1.6.0 are:


#### New autoconf tool

There is a new autoconf tool that is able to create MapProxy configurations
based on existing WMS services. It reads WMS capabilities documents and creates
sources and caches for all layers. It's a great way to get started with a new
service.

See: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.7.0/mapproxy_util_autoconfig.html>

#### Improved error handling in mapproxy-seed

Some services you need to seed are not as robust as you like. We improved `mapproxy-seed`
to be more resilient with unstable sources. It prints more useful error messages and retries
to request images for longer: seeding will not abort if a source is down for a few hours.


#### Python 2.5

MapProxy 1.7.0 is the last release with support for Python 2.5.

#### Other fixes and changes

There are many more changes and improvements.
