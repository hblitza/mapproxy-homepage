title: New MapProxy 1.3.0 release
---

We are ready to announce the release of MapProxy 1.3.0. It
contains major and minor improvements.

The latest release is available at: <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <http://mapproxy.org/docs/1.3.0/>

## New features

Some noteworthy improvements since 1.2.0 are:


#### RESTful WMTS

The MapProxy WMTS now also supports the RESTful API. This service
also supports custom URL templates for your service.

See [WMTS configuration](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/services.html#restful).

#### CouchDB cache backend

You can now use a CouchDB as a backend for tile caches.
Each cache gets stored into a separate database and you can
configure the layout of the URLs of each tile. You can also
add additional metadata for each tile.

<!-- With the help of custom CouchDB tile IDs and the RESTful WMTS, you can create a MapProxy and CouchDB setup where all tiles share the same URL path (like ``/mycache/MyGrid-5-2-5/tile``). -->

See [CouchDB configuration](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/caches.html#couchdb).


#### `mapproxy-util serve-multiapp-develop` tool

The new command is similar to `serve-develop` but it starts a
MultiMapProxy instance.

See [mapproxy-util documentation](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/mapproxy_util.html#serve-multiapp-develop).

#### Other features

- [Mapnik source now supports Mapnik 2.](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/sources.html#mapnik)

- You can limit the [maximum WMS response size in pixels with max_output_pixels](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/services.html#max-output-pixels).

- You can configure additional SRS for which MapProxy should [add bounding
 boxes to the WMS capabilities with the new wms.bbox_srs option](http://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/services.html#bbox-srs).
