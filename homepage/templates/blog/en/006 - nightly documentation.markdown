We integrated the documentation building into our testing system and as a result we are now able to provide up-to-date documentation of MapProxy.

You now find the latest documentation of the development trunk at: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/nightly/>

The official documentation of the latest release is still [available at the old location](https://mapproxy.org/docs/latest/).
