We are pleased to announce the release of MapProxy 1.10.0. It
contains a lot of major and minor improvements.

The latest release is available at: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MapProxy>

To upgrade within your virtualenv:

    $ pip install --upgrade --no-deps MapProxy

Updated documentation is available at: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.10.0/>

### Support for new cache backends

MapProxy now supports storing tiles in

- Amazon S3 cloud storage
- GeoPackage files
- Redis in-memory databases and
- ArcGIS Compact Cache files.

See: <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.10.0/caches.html#caches>

### Improved coverages

Areas outside a source coverage can be converted to a transparent background (clipping). It is now also possible to build the union, intersection or difference between multiple coverages.

See <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.10.0/coverages.html#clipping> and <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.10.0/coverages.html#union>

### MapProxy background seeding

The new `--duration` and `--reeseed-interval` options of `mapproxy-seed` allow you to run the seeding for a limited time (e.g. only at night).

See <https://mapproxy.org/docs/1.10.0/seed.html#example-background-seeding>


### Other fixes and changes

There are a lot more changes and improvements including improved ArcGIS REST sources, performance improvements for SQLite and MBTile caches and native GeoJSON support.
